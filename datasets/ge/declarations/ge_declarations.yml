  annual declarations of their assets, as well as members of their family and their assets.

  Officials making declarations here include national and sub-national members of the executive,
  legislature and judiciary. These are included in our dataset as Politically Exposed Persons,
  as well as their members of family. We exclude candidates who have not yet been elected.
