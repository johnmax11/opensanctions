  As part of the Common Foreign Security Policy the European Union publishes
  a sanctions list that is implemented by all member states.
description: |
  The combined sanctions list for the European Union, which is also the sanctions list
  used by most of the member states in place of publishing their own. Some countries, like
  France, do publish additional sanctions data with additional legal implications.

  Description from the web site:

  > The correct application of financial sanctions is crucial in order to meet the
  > objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and especially to help prevent
  > the financing of terrorism. The application of financial sanctions constitutes an
  > obligation for both the public and private sector. In this regard, the EU assigns
  > particular responsibility to credit and financial institutions, since they are
  > involved in the bulk of financial transfers and transactions affected by the relevant
  > Regulations.
  > 
  > In order to facilitate the application of financial sanctions, the European
  > Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of
  > Co-operative Banks and the European Association of Public Banks ("the EU Credit Sector
  > Federations") and the Commission recognised the need for an EU consolidated list
  > of persons, groups and entities subject to CFSP related financial sanctions. It was
  > therefore agreed that the Credit Sector Federations would set up a database
  > containing the consolidated list for the Commission, which would host and maintain
  > the database and keep it up-to-date. This database was developed first and foremost
  > to assist the members of the EU Credit Sector Federations in their compliance with
  > financial sanctions.
  > 
  > **Disclaimer:** While every effort is made to ensure that the database and the
  > consolidated list correctly reproduce all relevant data of the officially adopted
  > texts published in the Official Journal of the European Union, neither the Commission
  > nor the EU credit sector federations accepts any liability for possible omissions
  > of relevant data or mistakes, and for any use made of the database or of the
  > consolidated list. Only the information published in the Official Journal of the EU
  > is deemed authentic.
